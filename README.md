# Project Features

I built a brand shop website for TechNest with react, react router, firebase, mongodb & vercel . In my website , I have some exciting features:

- **Brand Cards:** Users can easily check out the Brands in the homepage with interactive cards. The website simplifies the process of seeing the renowned brands and provides an intuitive interface. User can easily navigate to different cards with differnet brands and product, price info.

- **Brand Details:** The website offers users the ability to view the product of best brands in the brand Details Page. Users simply have to click the brands and then their will be a products page. In that page, just click the product details button in the card and get the details info about product.
